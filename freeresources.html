                <h1 class="sub-title dp">About this resources</h1>

                <p class="first-paragraph-dp">Living intentionally is vital for achieving the goals which you set for yourself. It means taking accountability and making conscious choices about how to spend time and energy. </p>

                <p>
                    Many of us have had every intention to start a project in a few minutes and then have had an entire evening Consumed instead with high dopaminergic, low-effort activities like binge-watching Netflix which will ultimately leads to a sense of emptiness and a lack of fulfilment. It’s difficult in the moment to say no to activities which you know will spike your dopamine especially when you have already experienced an artificial dopamine spike earlier in the day.
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, meaningful work and productive derive from living intentionally. To live intentionally, one must first understand what they want from the future. 
                </p>

                <p> This requires a “gap analysis” as we would say in project management. Once the gap analysis is complete, it's time to populate how to get to the desired state by writing SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound goals).  </p>

                <div class="services-list daily-planner">
                   
                    <div>
                        <h2 class="SMART">Gap Analysis</h2>
                        <p> This is where we compare where we are currently with what we want from the future. This process involves examining one's values, strengths, weaknesses, and aspirations. By doing this, an individual can gain clarity on what they truly want in life and create a roadmap to achieve it.</p>
                    </div>
        
                    <div>
                        <h2 class="SMART" >SMART</h2>
                        <p>
                            These goals help to clarify what needs to be done to achieve the desired outcome. SMART goals set a realistic parameter to what can be achieved and the timeframes which the individual have set for themselves. This will assist us in not only realising what we want from the future but not being that one friend who tells everyone about their “new idea that’s going to be so successful” for them to ultimately never conduct meaningful work on that project/endeavour. A further example of this would be the 43-year old aspiring artist who never made it off the Karoake machine of the ‘Red Lion’ pub around the corner from your house.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h1 class="sub-title dp">Skills and knowledge are important</h1>
                <div class="last-paragraph dp">
                    <p> Acquiring the knowledge and skills necessary to achieve these goals is also essential. It's important to identify the skills and knowledge required and to seek out resources to acquire them. This could involve learning how to do the thing yourself or seeking the help of others who possess the relevant skills. Collaborating with others who share similar goals can also be a great way to achieve success and establish an “accountnability partner” is a great way to stay on track. We can all make promises to ourselves when we feel motivated but 2 days later at 6am are you going to wakeup and go to the gym or hit the snooze button? Well if you have someone holding you accountable and dragging you out of the bed, the odds are your more likely to achieve the goal.</p>

                    <div class="services-list">
                   
                        <div>
                            <p> In summary, the road to fulfillment in life and realising who and what you want to be can be long and arduous but making conscious choices investing time in trying new things and setting goals will always get you a greater ROI then Netflix and cake. </p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p> 
                        Therefore I’ve created a free resource which sets a schedule for the day which can be used to map out how your time will be used throughout the day. Further to this daily view I will be creating a ‘Vision board’ PDF which will outline goals for the future which could span from a couple of months in the future to 5-10 years. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Further to this a 2 week sprint PDF which will allow you to plan how many hours you can devote to your goals in the next 2 weeks. Planning in the short-medium term like this will assist in aligning your longer term goals with your daily goals and will also encourage routine and increase accountability as you decided the number of hours which you will devote.
